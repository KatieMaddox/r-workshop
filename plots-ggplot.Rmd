```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```

```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
#read in two data files, here tells R where to look

ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()
#creates line graph from ci_np dataframe

gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))
#saves our x and y variables so we can easily manipulate and insert other types of graphs without repeating the line of code, now gg_base is in our environment

gg_base + geom_point()
#takes pre-set x and y values and creates a scatterplot

gg_base + geom_col()
#same as above but now a column graph/bar chart

gg_base +  geom_area()
#area plot
```
```{r}
#Now on to customization of our base graphs. Customizations go in the () that follow the type of graph we want.
gg_base + geom_point(color="darkolivegreen4", pch=7, size=4, alpha=0.5)
#anotha one!
gg_base + geom_line(color="red", linetype="dashed")
```
```{r}
#Now using "aes," the aesthetics command, we can have our customizations dependent on the value of a variable to show contrast.
gg_base + geom_point(aes(size = visitors,color = visitors),alpha = 0.5)
#so the line above, the aes changes the size and color of points based upon the # of visitors (which was previously defined into gg_base). Having both color AND size change is overkill but just for learning's sake. Alpha is the same for all points because it's outside of 'aes'.
```
```{r}
#Now for my own attempt at a filled column chart of Channel Islands visitor data using aes with fill.
gg_base+geom_col(aes(fill=visitors))
```
